# The [[Home]] note vs [[Library]]
The [[Home|Home]] note is like the [[1942 - Foundation Series (1942-93)|First Foundation]], while the [[Library]] note is like the Second Foundation. 

- The first foundation is about ingenuity and free will. 
- The second foundation is about structuring chaos acceptably.
