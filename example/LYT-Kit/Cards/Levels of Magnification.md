# Levels of Magnification
*Analyzing a Problem Through Three Different Levels of Magnification*

Use this to define a problem and gain clarity.

I have found it useful to use three different levels of magnification when looking at some Thing and asking the question: 

*"What's the Problem?"*

- **Conceptual** (Macro) — This is the high-level perspective, philosophical, theoretical, existential
- **Practical** (Meso) — No fancy language, just the actual how-to of something
- **Technical** (Micro) — The nuts and bolts, diving deep into the specifics of a thing
