# Life Map ðŸ—º
I'm amazed at how many people don't zoom out and consider how to live a good life.

## Compass ðŸ§­
These are the dials that determine where I go.

- My Direction & Drivers
	- 01 - [[My Roles]] | [[My Permissions]]
	- 02 - [[My Environments]] | [[My Tools]]
	- 03 - [[My Experiences]] |  [[Life Reflections]]
	- 04 - [[My Virtues]] | [[My Skills]] | [[My Spark List]]
	- 05 - [[My Manifesto]] | [[My Goals]]
	- 06 - [[My Obituary]]

See those numbers above. They don't have to be there. I had a version of this note with them removed. But I like them in this map. For your own life map, do what works best for you!
