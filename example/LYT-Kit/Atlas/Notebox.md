# The Notebox 🗃
The Notebox is a place of joy—without expectations or obligations.

This will be a head-scratcher for a culture obsessed with tasks, but when you start giving your thoughts the honor the deserve, you start having better and better thoughts!

Here's how it works: When you are in a note and have a feeling that you want to return to it—for some fuzzy or clear reason—just add a tag in that note. Then through the magic of data views, you can confidently use these auto-updating lists to find them later:

## Boats 🚤
You probably made these notes in a rush. These [[BOAT notes]] are *lonely boats floating in an empty ocean*. All you need to do is tether them to other notes, and maybe develop them a little bit.

```dataview
List
from #note/boat🚤 
sort file.name asc
```

## Develop 🍃
You are probably excited to develop these notes. Do some note-making by linking to other notes. Clarify and critique it. Color and cite it. 

```dataview
LIST
FROM #note/develop🍃 
SORT file.name asc
```
