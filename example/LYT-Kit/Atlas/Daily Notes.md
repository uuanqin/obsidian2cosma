# Daily Notes
A daily note practice is great for many people. Try it out. Just never feel obligated to make a daily note every day. But do use them. They are great for a mixture of uses, such as: 

- planning your day
- jotting down ideas
- taking meeting notes
- reflecting on your day

The only things I have found I care to log consistently I have given tags:

- #log/event 
- #log/journal 
- #log/meeting

While I prefer to click on the Calendar (over in the upper right usually), below is a simple view of the latest daily notesâ€”including a few from the future:

```dataview
list
from "Calendar" and -#on/readme 
sort file.name desc
```
