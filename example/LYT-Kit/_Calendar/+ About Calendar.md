# This is where timestamped notes go
This folder called "Calendar" is mostly empty because this is just a starter kit and my daily notes are personal. Think about what notes you might want to sort by date. Here are some common types:

- Daily Notes
- Meeting Notes
- Workout Notes
- Log Notes
- Tracking Notes
- Outputted Materials: Articles, Speeches, etc
