# Dimensions of Reality
*What if you thought two dimensions was the entirety of reality?*

This premise that "there is something more" always strikes a chord in me. It's why I resonate with [[20220829214358|Plato's Cave]], The Matrix, Flatland...even The Truman Show! Bring on the existential angst I say! 

Some of the themes found in these works are:

- Knowing vs *Knowing*
- the choice of liberation
- the difficulties with that choice
- Violent reaction of having beliefs challenged
- choosing chains (the safe) - cypher
