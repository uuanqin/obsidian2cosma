# Concepts MOC
*A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.*
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these **conceptual** collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas. 

## Daily reminders of powerful concepts
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[20220829215622|OODA Loop]], [[20220828194300|Levels of Magnification]], and [[20220828191633|Refraction Thinking]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[20220829214150|Reps]], creating the conditions for [[20220830000619|Flow]], which involves environmental  [[20220724180730|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[20220503190814|Shadow Clone]]. 

[[20220829215025|Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[20220829194139|Lindy Effect]], along with [[20220829214423|Hormesis]] and [[20220829222053|Antifragility]]â€”and also more broadly [[20220724182056|Cause and Effect]]. This reminds me of [[20220829215321|Concept Expansion]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[20220505010104|Yin and Yang]], [[20220829214107|Synthesis]], [[20220829214732|Seasons]], and the [[20220829221904|Mountain Top Water Drop]]. Dealing with folks in the entertainment industryâ€”and just throughout life reallyâ€”there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[20220512053552|No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[20220505061552|The Id]]. [[20220829195201|Aikido]] is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspective, try to revisit the [[20220512053748|Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[20220824213329|Munger's Mental Models]].

## LYT Vision
Activate "LYT Vision" to resurface thoughts in context. When you twirl this open, it's like you are putting on night vision goggles: you see things hidden in the shadows.
