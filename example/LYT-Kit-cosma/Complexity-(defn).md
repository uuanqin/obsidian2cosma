# Complexity (defn)
**Complexity** is basically how many units of information weâ€™re looking at in a given system. 

In the LYT frameworks, the more links, the more complexity a note has.

How notes gain complexity mirrors the way we as humans gain complexity over the years: by experiencing new things that impact us and change who we are becoming.

Complexity relates to [[20220807025816|Divergence (defn)]] and [[20220627023753|Convergence (defn)]].
