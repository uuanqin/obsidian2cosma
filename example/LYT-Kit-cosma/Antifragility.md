# Antifragility
*Stronger from stressors!*

Obi-Wan Kenobi's quote from Star Wars always reminds me of Antifragility:

> *"If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."* 

In a sideways way, this ties into the metaphor of the phoenix being reborn from the ashes of the dragonâ€”and of the hydra having its head cut off, only to have two replace it. 

Using alliteration, it's: getting **stronger from stressors**, more settled from shaking, more adaptable from attacks.

In a way, antifragility is a faster form of [[20220829215025|Natural Selection]].

Antifragility is closely related to resilience/robustness, although resilience shouts *"Still standing after stressors!"*

### Wiki
Antifragility is a property of systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. 

It's fundamentally different from the concepts of resiliency (i.e. the ability to recover from failure) and robustness (that is, the ability to resist failure). 

Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.

Domains: The concept has been applied in physics, risk analysis, molecular biology, transportation planning, engineering, aerospace, megaproject management, and computer science.

Background: Developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
