# Library
Navigate your library of maps with a classification system made specifically for PKM. 

The **LYT Classification System** is lightly modified from the Cutter, Dewey, and Universal Decimal classification systems used in libraries around the world. It will provide you a time-tested foundation as you structure the interests of your digital library.

- 000 - *Knowledge Management*
- 100  - *Personal Management*
- 200 - *Philosophy & Psychology; Spirituality & Religion*
- 300 - *Social Sciences*
- 400 - *Communications & Rhetoric; Language & Linguistics*
- 500 - *Natural Sciences*
- 600 - *Applied Sciences*
- 700 - *Art & Recreation*
- 800 - *Literature*
- 900 - *History & Biography & Geography*

It is ready-made to hold your diverse interests. Add some placeholders below.

## 000 - Knowledge Management
The [[20220829214451|Meta PKM]] shows the best practices of knowledge management. I use the [[20220910222356|LYT Kit]] to show the power of linked thinking and to empower others to develop their thinking. The [[Mapping MOCs]] is my personal note to wrap my head around the wondrous beauty that MOCs offer. Others include:

- [[20220829214459|Notebox]] | [[LOL]] |  [[I want to...]]
- [[Cartographer's Corner ðŸ—º]] | [[20220829213945|Commonplace Book]] |  [[Knowledge and memory MOC]]

## 100 - Personal Management
The [[20220829214102|Thinking MOC]] can galvanize my attention; the [[20220923162736|Concepts MOC]] can flavor it; and the [[20220905183035|Habits MOC]] speaks about how to direct it. Hidden within in the [[20220828213435|Cabin]]. Go to my [[20220831003718|Life Map]] to brush up on [[20220829170530|My Virtues]] and more.

- [[Posture MOC]] | [[Hormesis MOC]] | [[Breathing Exercises MOC]] | Flowcreation MOC
- People MOC | Family MOC | [[Prominent People (kit)]]
- Efforts MOC | [[Life Command âŒ˜]] | Plans and Reviews
- Finances MOC | Health MOC

## 200 - Philosophy, Psychology ; Spirituality, Religion
Is there no limit to this section? I use [[20220829214154|Philosophy MOC (kit)]] as the big note and then point to things like: [[Stoicism MOC]], [[Confucianism MOC]], [[Religion MOC]], [[Taoism MOC]], and whatever else comes up.

[[20220829214535|Psychology MOC (kit)]] is similar but different enough to have its own space.

## 300 - Social Sciences ðŸ‘¥
*The study of human society and of individual relationships in and to society.*
While this a very important section, I have found it's a bit more intimate, as strange as that sounds, so I'm hesitant to share too much here. The best place to start is the [[20220923162947|People MOC]]. along with.

See also: [[People MOC#Prominent People ðŸŒ‹|Prominent People ðŸŒ‹]] | Politics | Society | Law | Relationships

## 400 - Communications, Language, & Linguistics
A fun section of the library, the 400s contains the underrated and oft-maligned subject of [[Rhetoric MOC]]. And one cannot talk long about rhetoric without talking about [[20220829214446|Language MOC]], [[Words MOC]], and especially [[Figures MOC]]. Not too far behind is the [[Leadership MOC]].

## 500 - Natural Sciences
A sharp break from the previous section, the 500s explore the natural world and universe in glorious notes like [[Cosmology MOC]] and [[Math MOC]]. 

See also: Chemistry | Geology | Plants | Animals | [[20220825051121|Systems MOC (kit)]]

## 600 - Applied Sciences
A natural progression from the previous section, this is where we take the the fundamentals of nature and *apply* them. My undergrad was in [[Engineering MOC]], which relates to my interest in [[Building Homes MOC]]. Later on, I developed the [[Editing Manual MOC]].

See also: Agriculture | Technology | Medical | [[AI MOC]] | Programming | [[Collective Intelligence MOC]] | [[Genetics MOC]] | 

## 700 - Art & Recreation
Ah the leisures of life. Remember leisure? Few really do. This section could easily balloon. 

- Art MOC | [[Design MOC]] | Architecture | Painting | 
- Film & TV | [[Movies MOC]] 
- Sports | [[Football MOC]] 
- Music | [[Jazz MOC]] | [[Vocals MOC]] 
- [[Cooking MOC]] | Leisure 

## 800 - Literature
If folks barely remember leisure, they likely completely forgot about classical literature. A great shame, neomania...we blind ourselves to some of humanity's greatest hits. Use [[Literature MOC]] as a launchpad.

## 900 - History & Biography & Geography
I've noticed I'm naturally building up the [[Ancient Greece MOC]], but I haven't cared to build out the [[History MOC]] just yet. The [[20220829214158|Places MOC]] is a peculiarly powerful note that has big things in store for it.

The [[Art & Science Storytelling MOC]] look at some great storytellers of history.
