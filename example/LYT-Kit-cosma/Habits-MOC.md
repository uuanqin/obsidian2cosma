> [!NOTE]+ Navigate with your new MOC
> Connect your new MOC with the the rest of your network of knowledge so you can *navigate your notes near the speed of thought*.

> Enjoy the spatial constellation you created. Your MOCs will be meaningful to you.

> Use your more mature MOCs for different purposes:

> - as a reference point in the future, as a navigational hub
> - for the inherent joy the ideas provide.

> As you finish work on an area of interest, the MOC remains as a renewable summation of thought for the future you. An MOC is your easy access point back into the topic—whether that's tomorrow or in ten years.

## LYT Vision
Activate "LYT Vision" to resurface thoughts in context. When you twirl this open, it's like you are putting on night vision goggles: you see things hidden in the shadows.

The main contextual queries I prefer are "unrequited" & "unmentioned" notes. 

### Unrequited notes, by link
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from [[20220905183035|Habits MOC]]
and !outgoing([[20220905183035|Habits MOC]])
sort file.mtime desc
```

### Unmentioned notes, with related tag
These notes have the tag `#` and are not mentioned above.

```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from #on/habit 
and !outgoing([[20220905183035|Habits MOC]])
sort file.mtime desc
```
