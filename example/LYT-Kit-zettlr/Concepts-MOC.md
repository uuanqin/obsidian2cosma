# Concepts MOC
*A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.*
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these **conceptual** collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas. 

## Daily reminders of powerful concepts
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [OODA Loop]([[20220829215622]]), [Levels of Magnification]([[20220828194300]]), and [Refraction Thinking]([[20220828191633]]).

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [Reps]([[20220829214150]]), creating the conditions for [Flow]([[20220830000619]]), which involves environmental  [Forcing Functions]([[20220724180730]]), and considering when I can multitask [Shadow Clone]([[20220503190814]]). 

[Natural Selection]([[20220829215025]]) is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [Lindy Effect]([[20220829194139]]), along with [Hormesis]([[20220829214423]]) and [Antifragility]([[20220829222053]])â€”and also more broadly [Cause and Effect]([[20220724182056]]). This reminds me of [Concept Expansion]([[20220829215321]]).

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [Yin and Yang]([[20220505010104]]), [Synthesis]([[20220829214107]]), [Seasons]([[20220829214732]]), and the [Mountain Top Water Drop]([[20220829221904]]). Dealing with folks in the entertainment industryâ€”and just throughout life reallyâ€”there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [No-Face]([[20220512053552]]) from Spirited Away, which leads to [The Id]([[20220505061552]]). [Aikido]([[20220829195201]]) is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspective, try to revisit the [Rubik's Cube]([[20220512053748]]), or pull from [Munger's Mental Models]([[20220824213329]]).

## LYT Vision
Activate "LYT Vision" to resurface thoughts in context. When you twirl this open, it's like you are putting on night vision goggles: you see things hidden in the shadows.
