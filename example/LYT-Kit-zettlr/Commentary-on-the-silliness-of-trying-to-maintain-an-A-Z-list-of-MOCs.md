# Commentary on the silliness of trying to maintain an A-Z list of MOCs
For those that want to maintain an alphabetical "Map of Maps" list, check this out. The below list *was* in alphabetical order a long time ago. But as I make sense of the world, I constantly tweak filenames. So now look at how out of order it has become. 

This is why you should just use the tag `#MOC` for your alphabetical list instead.
