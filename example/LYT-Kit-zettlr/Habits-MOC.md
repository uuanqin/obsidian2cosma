# Habits MOC
*I am an unrelenting evolutionary adaptation—whether you like it or not!*

## LYT Vision
Activate "LYT Vision" to resurface thoughts in context. When you twirl this open, it's like you are putting on night vision goggles: you see things hidden in the shadows.

The main contextual queries I prefer are "unrequited" & "unmentioned" notes. 

### Unrequited notes, by link
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from [Habits MOC]([[20220905183035]])
and !outgoing([Habits MOC]([[20220905183035]]))
sort file.mtime desc
```

### Unmentioned notes, with related tag
These notes have the tag `#` and are not mentioned above.

```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from #on/habit 
and !outgoing([Habits MOC]([[20220905183035]]))
sort file.mtime desc
```
