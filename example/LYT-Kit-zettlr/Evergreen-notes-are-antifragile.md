# Evergreen notes are antifragile
The most profound and revolutionary aspect of evergreen notes is that they exhibit [Antifragility]([[20220829222053]]). The effects of this are hard to overstate.

In essence, that means they grow more valuable as they encounter more stressors. I.e. As you encounter related ideas, you link them to your existing evergreen noteâ€”even if they directly contradict your existing note. 

Each link, if made deliberately, is adding value to the note. It's adding perspective, counter-arguments, supporting arguments, allusions to different domains, and so on.
