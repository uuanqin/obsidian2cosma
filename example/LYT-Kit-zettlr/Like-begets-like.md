# Like begets like
*It's circular but true, we become what we do.*

[Like begets like]([[20220829215344]]) is the natural process of Evolution's [Selfish Gene]([[20220828211810]]). 

Because [Natural Selection]([[20220829215025]]) demands that organisms become more efficient to increase its chances of survival (see [Survival of the Fittest]([[20220829211504]])). 

Said another way, evolution's [Selfish Gene]([[20220828211810]]) has a Prime Directive: survive. It this way, Nature is neutral. It grows what you feed it. You are what you eat. 

That means whatever you do, whatever tiny action or thought, creates neural pathways; and neural pathways strengthen with use (see: [The neural formation of habits is additive]([[20220829183314]])).

Others: *You are what you eat. I am what I am.*

This is a first principle; perhaps one of the most fundamental first principles...one with major ramifications
